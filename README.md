# Project-2.0-Statistics-Concepts
## Applying concepts of statistics, data types, and matrix operations to analyze and transform a dataset



Instructions

Problem:
 

You are given the following dataset represented as a matrix:


       D = 

              [ 4   8  12 ]

              [ 6  10  15 ]

              [ 5   7   9  ]

              [ 3   6   9  ]
 

Each row represents a different region, and each column represents a specific product category (A, B, C). The values in the matrix are sales quantities.
 

Tasks:

Part 1: Understanding the Data

Data Types:
 
Identify the data type of the matrix elements.
 
Descriptive Statistics:
 
Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each column (Product A, B, and C).
 
Variability:
 
For each column, determine:
 
The range (difference between maximum and minimum values).
The variance
Part 2: Linear Algebra

Matrix Operations:
 
Compute the transpose of the matrix.
 
Transforming the Data:
 
Multiply the matrix D by a price vector P, where:

                         P=[5 10 15]
 
Identify Patterns:
 
Determine which region generates the highest revenue.
For each product, calculate the total revenue across all regions. 
Part 3: Conceptual Questions

Interpretation:
 
What does the mean tell you about the typical sales for each product?
How does the coefficient of variation help you understand sales consistency across products?
 
Application:
 
Discuss how matrix multiplication is used in real-world data science problems (e.g., revenue calculations, recommendation systems).
